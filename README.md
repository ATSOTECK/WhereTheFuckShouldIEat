# Where The ~~Fuck~~ Should I Eat
CS470 Project - Working title.

---
Authors: Skyler Burwell, Brent Dunbar, Spencer Brown

Each section has it's own simplistic README to run this project,

to run the client without the backend run:
    npm install
    npm start

the proxy and server files are a bit more complex and their README's reflect that information.
